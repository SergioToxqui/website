            My name is Sergio Toxqui.  My last name is the french take on the nahualt word 'voice' (itozqui).  That word is also used to describe a leader in the community.  I feel like it fits me, people consider me a leader in my community, workplace and social circle.
            <br><br>
            My community organizing experience includes co-founding and the administration of T.R.E.A., a youth mentorship organization which focuses on fostering inclusive dialogue on all aspects of diversity and self-development.  In addition, I have volunteered at Barrios Unidos,  a collective of neighbors fighting displacement. Specifically working to help small businessâ€™ owners develop the necessary tech and digital marketing skills to propel their business forward.
            <br><br>
            As the Director of Online Operations at Army Navy I have extensive database management, and site-management experience.  I also trained the managers how to run daily tasks and how to use and report on logistics, analytics and KPI's.  I created the policy and procedures manual.  As well as forming and implementing the systems from customer service to shipping.  When it comes to managing people i believe in systems and follow ups, standards to hold people accountable for.
            <br><br>
            In my personal time I am a visual artist.  I have made murals for restaurants, non profits and high schools.  As for digital media I have made business cards, ads,  banners and postcards for small businesses.  I also love painting with acrylics and giving hand made cards for birthdays.
